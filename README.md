# "Comprehensive Analysis of Fugitive GHG Emissions and Economic Impact: Mitigating Environmental and Financial Inefficiencies"

## Objective:
* To analyze and evaluate the levels of fugitive greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from various facilities of Huanle Noodles between January 1, 2021, and December 1, 2023. The primary aim is to identify the main contributors to fugitive emissions, assess which gases contribute the most to the total emission volume, and understand the financial implications of these emissions as energy losses or inefficiencies. Additionally, the objective is to recommend strategies to mitigate emissions, reduce energy waste, and minimize financial losses.

## Goal:

* Identify the total fugitive GHG emissions across all Huanle Noodles facilities.
* Pinpoint the specific leak assets that contribute the most emissions and potential financial losses.
* Analyze the composition of GHGs per facility to determine the most problematic gases and estimate the associated energy and financial losses.
* Provide actionable recommendations to reduce overall emissions and inefficiencies, focusing on major emission contributors to improve both environmental performance and operational cost efficiency.

## Analysis Summary:
1. Facility: Cebu Warehouse
* Total fugitive emission GHGs: 689 kg
* Highest leak asset: HVAC leak asset no. 19192 contributing 627.9 kg (91% of the total).
* Top 3 highest GHGs:
  - CH4 (Methane): 97.3 kg
  - HFCs (Hydrofluorocarbons): 95.1 kg
  - NF3 (Nitrogen Trifluoride): 92.3 kg
