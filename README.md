# "Comprehensive Analysis of Fugitive GHG Emissions and Economic Impact: Mitigating Environmental and Financial Inefficiencies"

## Objective:
* To analyze and evaluate the levels of fugitive greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from various facilities of Huanle Noodles between January 1, 2021, and December 1, 2023. The primary aim is to identify the main contributors to fugitive emissions, assess which gases contribute the most to the total emission volume, and understand the financial implications of these emissions as energy losses or inefficiencies. Additionally, the objective is to recommend strategies to mitigate emissions, reduce energy waste, and minimize financial losses.

## Goal:

* Identify the total fugitive GHG emissions across all Huanle Noodles facilities.
* Pinpoint the specific leak assets that contribute the most emissions and potential financial losses.
* Analyze the composition of GHGs per facility to determine the most problematic gases and estimate the associated energy and financial losses.
* Provide actionable recommendations to reduce overall emissions and inefficiencies, focusing on major emission contributors to improve both environmental performance and operational cost efficiency.

## Valuable Insights:
1. Consistent Asset Leakage Across Facilities:
* The HVAC leak asset no. 19192 consistently accounts for around 90% of the fugitive emissions across all facilities. This suggests a critical need for maintenance or replacement of this specific asset. Reducing leakage from this source can significantly lower overall emissions.
2. Top GHG Contributors:
* Across the facilities, the highest contributors to emissions are HFCs, CH4, and CO2. This implies that the company needs to focus on reducing emissions from these gases, especially HFCs, which are potent GHGs with high global warming potential.
3. Facility Performance:
* Some facilities, like Cebu Warehouse, KL Sales Office, and Tuas Warehouse, have higher total emissions than others. Targeting these higher-emitting facilities for improvement could lead to the most significant emission reductions.
4. Emission Reduction Focus:
* HFCs have emerged as the largest contributor across all facilities (503.7 kg), followed by CH4 (445.5 kg). This suggests that replacing or upgrading cooling systems that use HFCs and improving containment of methane emissions could provide the most substantial benefit in emission reductions.

## Recommendations:
1. Immediate Inspection and Repair of HVAC Systems:
* Given that HVAC leak asset no. 19192 is the highest source of emissions, conducting an immediate inspection and repair (or replacement if necessary) across all facilities should be prioritized.
2. Adoption of Low-GWP Alternatives:
* For HFCs, the company should consider transitioning to low-GWP (global warming potential) refrigerants or other cooling technologies that produce fewer GHG emissions.
3. Methane Containment:
* Since CH4 emissions are a significant contributor, better containment strategies for methane leaks should be explored. Regular inspection and maintenance of equipment responsible for methane leaks could help reduce overall emissions.
4. Energy Audits and Leak Detection Programs:
* Implementing energy audits and installing leak detection and repair (LDAR) programs at facilities would help identify other possible sources of emissions and prevent future leaks.
5. Focus on High-Emission Facilities:
* Targeting emissions reduction efforts in the highest-emitting facilities (Cebu Warehouse, KL Sales Office, Tuas Warehouse) would yield the greatest reduction in total GHG emissions.
